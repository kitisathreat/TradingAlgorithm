The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested websockets<11 and >=9.0
    yfinance 0.2.63 depends on websockets>=13.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested websockets<11 and >=9.0
    yfinance 0.2.63 depends on websockets>=13.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
